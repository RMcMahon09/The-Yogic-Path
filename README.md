# The-Yogic-Path
The Life of A Yogi; Spiritually, Mentally, and Physically.  Yoga.  Nutrition.  Routines.


H3LL0!

The Yogic Path is website/bog that I would like to create to shine a little light on the life of a yogi.  The different paths that one takes including a spiritual, physical, and mental.  The different routines of meditation and yoga that a yogi may perform and also the type of diet is needed to be a yogi.  This is one of my first major personal projects and I hope it's a huge success! The Sky is the Limit!
